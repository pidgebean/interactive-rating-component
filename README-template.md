## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned more about how JavaScript interacts with the different screens, and how buttons affect that. At first, I was having a lot of trouble keeping the altered states once the button was pressed. Turns out you just need to add the type in button tag.
